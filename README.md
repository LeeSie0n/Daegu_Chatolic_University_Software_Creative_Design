To put it simply, this project is a secure QR code scanner and a solution to prevent Qshing.

Qshing is a combination of the words QR code and phishing, and refers to an attack that steals personal and financial information through QR codes. We recently saw damage related to Qshing and started this project to prevent such damage.

This team consists of Team Leader Lee Ji-won, Team Member Oh Na-hee, and Team Member Lee Si-eon, who majored in computer engineering at Daegu Catholic University. The code and data set of this project are copyrighted to our team, the developers. If you would like to use them, please contact us first.
